Data repository about non-conventional water ressources 

In a first step, journals, conferences, internet presentations and patents are screened and expert knowledge from associations (e.g. IWA, German Water Partnership) as well of their members is collected to identify the most important approaches in non-conventional water. A summary of the results allows a first evaluation of technologies considering several criteria like TRL, market availability, energy consumption, maintenance, operation, and economic performance (incl. CAPEX, OPEX). The task will deliver D3.1, the data collected, and D3.2, the summarizing report.

Data about non-conventional water in the Mediterranean region is compiled from various sources. References to this data are collected in a repository that is available to the public.
